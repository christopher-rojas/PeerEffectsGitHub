Program to estimate the peer influence effect by comparing the ratio of items starred by treated agents, to the ratio of items starred by matched, non-treated agents. Treatment can be defined based on the number of a users' followees who recently adopted, and we analyze 1, 2 and 3 adopting leaders. You must specify the periods to include and the directory where the matched-sample is located. You must also specify the type of non-parametric bootstrap method to use for computing 95% confidence intervals: regular or pigeonhole. The output is a .csv file with the mean treatment effect, upper/lower confidence limits, and number of observations, for each level of treatment and each period.

I include the estimated treatment effect output, for periods 1 through 10, using the regular bootstrap.
