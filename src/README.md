# Useage Instructions
There are separate directories corresponding to the different steps in our empirical analysis:

1) Download data from the GitHub Archive

2) Format/Clean the data 

3) Estimate Preferences 

4) Match nearest-neighbors 

5) Estimate the peer influence effect on the matched sample.

6) Perform Simulation

7) Estimate Treatment Effects

To build everything from scratch, you must run each of these in order. However, I have included the formatted data from the end of step 2 on my personal website at https://www.carojas.com/research, so you do not need to rebuild the data from scratch and could start from step 3.

Click on each of the directories for a more detailed readme for that step.
