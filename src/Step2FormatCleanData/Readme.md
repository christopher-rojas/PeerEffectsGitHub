After getting the GH Archive data, we need extract and clean the data that we will be using. Use the program "starsMongoExtract.py" to take only the stars data out of the database, and use the program "followsMongoExtract.py" to take out the follows data. These programs will create one .csv file for each months' worth of data. Then we can clean and combine the stars and follows files by using the program "combineCleanData.py." This program will clean the data (e.g. drop duplicates) and combine the monthly .csv files into one file, then delete the monthly .csv files. You must specify the range of months for which you have data.

After creating the data, use the programs "ids.py" and "idsMerge.py" to create id numbers for each user and each repo, and to replace usernames and repo names with ids. The program "joinsExitsUsers.py" can be used to build a .csv file with the earliest and latest date that each agent shows up in the data, which we can use as a proxy for join and exit dates. In both the id and join/exit programs, you must specify the directory in which the star and following files are located.
