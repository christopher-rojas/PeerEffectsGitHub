Use the program "collectArchiveData.py" in the directory "DownloadGH_ArchiveData." The file will download data from the GitHub Archive and dump it into a mongo database. The files are in json and there is one file to download for each hour. You must specify the host ip address, username and password for the database, using the parameters "MONGO_HOST", "MONGO_USER" and "MONGO_PASSWORD," respectively. You can also specify the earliest and latest datetimes (to the nearest hour) for which you want to get the data. By default they are set to February 12, 2011 at 00:00:00 and October 31, 2013 at 23:00:00.

This program will create a mongo database with a separate collection for each month of data. Note that the storage size can get pretty big, for the data in our paper it was about 500 GB.
